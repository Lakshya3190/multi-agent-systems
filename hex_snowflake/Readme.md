## Summary

In this model, each dead cell will become alive if it has exactly one neighbor. Alive cells stay alive forever.

## How to Run

To run the model interactively, run ``mesa runserver`` in this directory. e.g.

```
    $ mesa runserver
```

Then open your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:8521/](http://127.0.0.1:8521/) and press ``run``.
